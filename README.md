## Objective: Build a logistic regression model using gradient descent techniques to predict O-Ring failure at varying launch temperatures

The O-ring was determined to be the cause of the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster of 1986. The O-ring was a circular gasket that was intended to seal off one of the rocket boosters. Various analyses revealed that proper O-ring sealing would have occurred at greater launch temperature conditions. The goal here is to produce a logistic regression model that would be able to predict O-ring performance (failure or success) at any given temperature. Gradient descent techniques will be used to optimize the model's loss function, which will help to determine optimal model parameters.
